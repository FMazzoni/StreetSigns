This gives all street signs in Boston MA using OSNMX one can obtain street interesection data and such derive a good estimate for all street signs within a city. Big Cities like Boston will require some cleaning after the fact, accounting for "nan" streets, and fixing boundary conflicts. For smaller cities this can be enough to get a very close estimate.
